# Web service for retrieving a list of samples

## Presentation

Two services are available: the first allows you to retrieve only the list of UIDs concerned, the second allows you to retrieve all the information.  
The search engine is identical to that used in the web interface, except that the search is only performed within a single collection. This last point is linked to the security measures put in place for querying via the APIs.

## Call method

~~~
apiv1sampleList : complete list
apiv1sampleUids : list of UIDs
~~~

## Parameters

Parameters suffixed with _\_id_ must be searched for in the application parameters (web interface). The programme does not search for values corresponding to labels, as is done elsewhere in the import procedures.

Parameters are cumulative, except for metadata, which is multi-valued.

### Mandatory parameters
