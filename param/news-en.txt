Version 1.1 of September 01, 2017
---------------------------
Collec becomes Collec-Science.

Updated schemas of the required database (default GACL and COL schemas). Scripts to use:

Printing labels:
- it is possible to integrate the localization (sampling location)

Managing the metadata associated with a sample:
- it is possible to describe metadata, and associate them with types of samples
- by modifying a sample, it is possible to enter the metadata
- these can be embedded in a label template, and are included in the exported CSV file for off-collec-science printing

Rights and Entitlements Management:
- installing a new version of the application engine
- for the users identified in the local database, it is now possible for them to request a reset of the password (requires in advance that the email address has been filled in, and that the server supports the sending of mails)
- access to administration modules requires re-identification
- in case of repeated failures of connection, an email alert is sent to the administrators (their email must have been declared beforehand, the server must authorize the sending of mails)
- the connection to a CAS server has been corrected. The entire identification procedure has been reviewed

- when launching the application, the version of the database is now verified
- an automatic database generation script is now available for new installations

Version 1.0.7a of May 12, 2017
---------------------------
Bugfix :
- generated tags were not sorted
- if the sample came from another database, the sort on the UID in the table was no longer numeric, but alphabetical (moving the original UID in the Other identifiers column)

Version 1.0.7 of May 10, 2017
---------------------------
Bug fixes:
- in mass import, the status of containers or samples are mandatory, but it was not specified
- since the detail of a container, the list of the samples did not display the data for all the columns, whose secondary identifiers
- in label generation, if a field was not specified in the QR Code, it was not available for display in the body of the label

New features or Enhancements:
- it is now possible to create a new sample or a new container without launching a preliminary search (this disturbed the users)
- labels: it is possible to display the product used for storage (column storage_product)
- printing labels: it is now possible to use another model than the one associated with the type of container

Version 1.0.6a of April 03, 2017
---------------------------
Fixed a bug:
- when entering a movement from the detail of an object, the list of containers associated with a type was not displayed

Version 1.0.6 of March 03, 2017
---------------------------
Updating the necessary database (script install / col_alter_1.0.5-1.0.6.sql)
Bug fixes:
- the modification of the subsamples did not work
- Several anomalies prevented the user from changing a password. After editing, the screen was blank.
- in mass import, if the container_parent_id field was filled, and no container was specified, the movement was not generated
- the program allowing the reading of the scans removes the spaces potentially added by the hand shower before the wording read
- the storage / range column has been renamed to storage / storage_location

New features and Enhancements:
- in the sample table, the parent sample is now displayed
- the sample table can now be exported in various formats
- It is now possible to indicate the identifier of the original database of a sample. This makes it possible to scan a tag generated by another implementation of the application, to facilitate exchanges. Added field: sample / dbuid_origin, expected format: db: uid
- in the detail of a sample or a container, the user now has simultaneous access to input or output movements (previously, only the opposite operation was possible)
- when entering an input movement from the detail of an object, the name of the container is displayed if its uid is entered manuallyainer est affiché si son uid est saisi manuellement

Version 1.0.5a of February 08, 2017
----------------------------
Fixed a bug preventing the deletion of a container

Version 1.0.5 of February 02, 2017
---------------------------
Updating the necessary database (script install / col_alter_1.0.4-1.0.5.sql)
Bug fixes:
- When assigning management rights to projects, LDAP or inherited groups were not properly processed
- Fast entry of samples, the container was not properly read after the first movement. In case of code error, the uid was not correctly erased
- the label model was not deleted after generation in the temporary folder, which precluded the development phases

Enhancements:
- addition of a table of sampling zones: it is now possible to attach a sample to a previously defined geographical area (usable in search of samples)
- it is now possible to scan barcodes that contain business identifiers, and that have not been generated by the application (either 1D barcode with the identifier, QR Code with the identifier or an http address)
- csv export (to generate labels with third party software) now includes xy coordinates

Documentation:
- Adding the installation procedure of PHP7 with Debian 8

Version 1.0.4 of January 18, 2017
---------------------------
Updating the necessary database (script install / col_alter_1.0-1.0.4.sql)
Bug fixes:
- reading a QR Code from a camera did not work if the camera used did not have a rear camera (environment camera)
- the selection of the type of container did not work if there was only one in a family of containers
- the search for containers did not work in capturing a movement
- when entering a sample, the type of container was not explicit enough

Enhancements:
- the date of the last movement of the objects is displayed in the lists
- the creation date of the objects was passed in date / time
- it is now possible to integrate the GPS position of an object in a label or in the QR Code
- it is now possible to integrate the creation date of an object in a label or in the QR Code
- by modifying an object, the map is now displayed, and it is possible to position the location of the object by clicking on it
- In modification of an object, it is possible to position the object from the estimated position of the terminal (either by using the GPS coordinates for smartphones or tablets, or the location calculated from the computer network)

Setting :
- 3 new parameters can be defined, which concern the pre-positioning of the map when no coordinates have been entered: $ mapDefaultX and $ mapDefaultY center the map on the indicated point, $mapDefaultZoom is the default zoom factor

Documentation:
- the installation and configuration manual contains a new appendix that explains how to set up the synchronization of two postgresql servers, to avoid losing information
- a new section has been written to explain the operations to be performed during a software update

Version 1.0.3 of December 08, 2016
---------------------------
Bug fixes:
- table generation script: the project_group table was incorrectly named
- file param.inc.php.dist: the schemas for the connection to the main database were incomplete (variable $ BDD_schema)

---------------------------
Documentation:
- correction of the parameters to indicate for a good management of the multi-bases (access to the param.ini file)
- adding configuration for identification in HEADER mode

Enhancements:
