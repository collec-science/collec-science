# API for creating / modifying a sample

## Principle

This API allows, from a third party application, to create or modify a sample in a collection.

Two modes are available: either the third-party application provides columns that are in accordance with what is expected by Collec-Science, or it calls (in the variables provided) a _dataset_ model that will rename the columns, or even the contents of the reference tables.

Before any creation, the samples are searched according to several possible criteria. If no sample is found, it is created. If not, it is modified.

The API also creates referents, stations or campaigns if they do not exist beforehand.

If the UID or main identifier of the container is specified, the entry transaction will also be created.

## Identification

Consult this document to create the API user, generate a token and give him the appropriate rights: [Identification for web services](swidentification_en)

## Default call

> URL : apiv1sampleWrite

The API must be called in http **POST** mode.

### Sample search order

By default, unless a dataset template is used or search_order is filled in, samples are searched in the following order:

1.  uid: internal identifier in Collec-Science
2.  uuid: universal identifier
3.  identifier: business identifier. It is searched only in the considered collection.
