dbuid="when entering a sample, if it has been created in another database, it is possible to indicate the code of the initial database followed by the assigned identifier. This code will then be used during searches, which allows the labels initially affixed to be retained. "

collection="a collection is a coherent set of samples relating to a particular subject. Access rights to samples are managed by collection. It is also possible to attach collection points to them."

storage_condition="main characteristics of the method of storage (cold, controlled atmosphere, freeze-drying, etc.). Can also be used to describe the prior treatment of the sample for its conservation."

container="any object that may contain another. Not to be confused with derived samples or sub-samples."

sample_derivated="a sample created from another, whether of the same type or not, that has been identified independently. In other words, a sample that is the child of another. For example, a core section is derived from half core X, which in turn is derived from the whole core."

sample_empty="sample status. A sample whose entire core has been used. For example, a one-meter core, 10 10-inch core, there's nothing left of the sample."

label="labels can be associated with containers or samples. They contain two parts: a QRcode containing values that can be read automatically and a free content. The general QRcode contains at least the uid and the db. The special QRcode contains only a number. To activate the special case, click on Label containing only a business identifier".

container_family="large category of containers, to facilitate the search (room, site, crate...)"

container_latlong="for a room, building, site, etc., WGS84 coordinates in decimal form"

sample_latlong="place where the sample is taken. In fact, the geographic point associated with the sample. It can be edited by clicking in the map or on the link Locate your location!. This action, if performed in the field, will trigger the recording of the sample creation/collection location"

sampling_place="place or site where the sample was taken. The site is in fact generally a way of grouping the samples with respect to a spatial organization of the collection. This does not necessarily require precise geo-referencing, but can be used to codify the name of the sample and can help the researcher to define how they search/group their samples. When selecting a collection location for updating the longitude and latitude on the sample record, the longitude and latitude must be blank beforehand. Please note that if you do not specify a collection, the sample location will be available for all collections".

accuracy="accuracy of the localization of a sample (or container), in meters"

metadata="elements (such as names of harvesters, taxa, ...) that we want to add to each sample of a collection"

operation="An operation can be described as an action that changes the state of a sample. It results in the creation of a new sample derived from the previous one."

product="product used to preserve the sample (e.g. ethanol). Sometimes referred to as a storage product in the documentation"

protocol="protocol used to collect data. A protocol is a series of operations that help to produce (or even preserve) samples that can be used for research. In principle, it is a document that describes the different steps that follow a sampling."

referent="responsible for a collection and/or the sample and/or the container. In general, the referent of a container is only informed about the parts used for storage (the person who tells where to store the samples) or technical equipment that may break down (e.g. the fridge)"

subsample="part of a sample not individually identifiable (sampling of x material, one of 10 identical scales). In chemistry, can be assimilated to the aliquot"

status="indicates whether an object (sample or container) is still usable. The statuses can be varied and depend on the local operating mode (broken container, sample that no longer contains usable material, etc.)"

container_type="detailed type of container, specifying capacity, storage product or storage conditions if applicable, associated risks in case of handling, etc. This may be a site, building, room, cabinet, shelf, crate, canister, tube, etc. When creating a type of container, it is possible to indicate the number of available slots (number of rows or columns), which will contain one and only one object. This is a notion that takes on its full meaning for boxes containing multiple tubes, or cabinets for which one does not wish to declare the shelves. If nothing is specified, the number of places is at least 1 (one line, one column, mandatory for technical reasons). Containers are defined independently of collections"

sample_type="allows to define generic types - by type of container (tube, zip bag, ..) with the possibility to associate a metadata model"

event_type="event that may occur on a sample or container. The event can be external (e.g. broken container), voluntary (e.g. analysis) or involuntary (e.g. lost sample)"

identifier_type="it is possible to attach various identifiers to an object, e.g. international codes. Identifier types are used to describe them. If they are not numeric, these identifiers can also be used in searches or scans for input-output"

filetype="defines the types of files that can be imported in the different menus of the software. To know the important MIME types for the WEB, you can consult https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types"

uuid="36-character stored identifier, which is generated with cryptographic functions that make it unique, regardless of the system that produced it. Example: a95d8731-3501-4cc7-a71d-50ebd839b035. It is used to facilitate exchanges between databases, in place of the Database code:UID pair."

trashed="object awaiting deletion (trashed). Used to be able to indicate to external services that an object has been deleted"

translationTable="Table allowing to replace the labels present in the database by those expected by the recipient of the export"

campaign="Samples can be collected during sampling campaigns. It is possible to define, for a campaign, the applicable regulations and authorization numbers in case of an official decision"

authorization="Collection campaigns may require authorizations. It is possible to indicate, regulation by regulation, the number and date of the authorization"
