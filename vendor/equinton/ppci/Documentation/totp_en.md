# What is dual authentication?

When you identify yourself in the application, you use a login and a password, either that you have chosen or that has been provided to you.

If someone manages to discover your password, either by successive attempts or by tricking you, he will be able to log in for you in the software. To limit the risks, a second identification mechanism can be used, which will be based on the use of a device in your possession: this is double authentication. 

What is the device you always take with you, and from which you (almost) never part with? Your smartphone! This is the device we will entrust the second authentication to.

## How does it work?

A secret will be shared between the application and your smartphone. This secret is a cryptographic key, which is impossible to discover if you don't know it. In the application, this key is associated to your account.

An algorithm, based on the current time, generates a 6-digit code from this secret key. Smartphones and servers share the same time: they synchronize several times a day with reference clocks. As the algorithm used, the secret key, and the time are identical between the smartphone and the server, the generated code is necessarily identical. 

Thus, the application can easily verify that the code generated by the smartphone is identical to the one it can calculate, and make sure that you are the owner of the account used.

In practice, the code is valid for 30 seconds: at the end of this time, it is null and void, and a new code will be generated.

## How is the secret key exchanged?

At the moment of activation of the double authentication, the server will generate the secret key and encapsulate it in a QRCode, which will be displayed on the screen. It will be displayed on the screen. You just have to read it with a dedicated application and it will be saved in your smartphone.

The secret key is associated to your account in the database and is also encrypted with another mechanism: if it were to be recovered illegally, without the additional encryption keys, your secret key would remain unreadable.

Once the secret key is copied to your smartphone, it is never exchanged again, and unless you lose your smartphone, it is unlikely to be discovered.

## When should dual authentication be activated?

It is preferable to activate dual authentication when you have extended administration features in the application (account administration profile or application administration profile). 

If the application manages sensitive data, it is also advisable to enable this mechanism.

## What software can be used in the smartphone?

You must use software that supports the TOTP standard. Among the best known, you can install *Google Authenticator*, available only with Android, or *FreeOTP*, available on IOS or Android.

## What to do if you lose your smartphone or your secret key?

Ask an administrator to reset your secret key. If you are the last administrator of the application, you will need to (have) delete the secret key from the database.
